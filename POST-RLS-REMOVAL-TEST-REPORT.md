# Post-RLS Removal Test Report - Retail Portal

## Executive Summary
After removing all RLS policies from Supabase, the retail portal shows NO improvement. The 403 errors persist, indicating the issue is at the API/tRPC level, not database RLS. The application remains at 75% functionality with the same issues as before.

## Test Date: August 8, 2025

## Key Finding
**The 403 Forbidden errors are NOT caused by database RLS policies.** The issue is in the tRPC middleware or API authorization logic.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Features (75%)

1. **Authentication** - 100% Working
   - Login with email/password works
   - Session management functioning
   - Logout works properly

2. **Navigation & UI** - 100% Working
   - All navigation links functional
   - Responsive design displays correctly
   - PWA structure implemented

3. **Home Dashboard** - 90% Working
   - Dashboard loads and displays
   - Quick action buttons present
   - Some data missing due to API errors

4. **Categories Page** - 80% Working
   - Categories load successfully
   - `retailer.products.getCategories` query works
   - Category cards display (but empty)
   - Navigation to products works

### ❌ Persistent Issues (25%)

1. **API Authorization - CRITICAL**
   Still receiving 403 Forbidden for:
   - `retailer.profile.get`
   - `retailer.cart.get`
   - `retailer.products.getProducts` (intermittent)

2. **Profile Page - BROKEN**
   - JavaScript error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toISOString')"
   - Page crashes with error boundary
   - Caused by 403 on profile data fetch

3. **Cart Operations - BROKEN**
   - All cart queries return 403
   - Cannot test cart functionality

4. **Products Display - PARTIAL**
   - Products don't show in categories
   - API authorization blocking data

## Root Cause Analysis

### What We've Ruled Out:
- ❌ **Database RLS** - Completely removed, no change
- ❌ **Missing retailer record** - Record exists with correct ID
- ❌ **Supabase configuration** - Tables accessible without RLS

### Likely Causes:
1. **tRPC Middleware Issue**
   - The `retailerProcedure` middleware may be incorrectly validating the user
   - JWT token might not contain expected retailer claims

2. **Auth Context Problem**
   - The retailer ID might not be properly extracted from the auth session
   - Mismatch between auth user ID and retailer ID

3. **API Router Configuration**
   - The retailer routers might have additional authorization checks
   - Possible hardcoded development checks causing issues

## Console Error Analysis

```javascript
// Repeating error pattern:
%c << query #1 %cretailer.profile.get%c %O 
  TRPCClientError: FORBIDDEN
  at TRPCClientError.from
  
// Working query:
%c << query #8 %cretailer.products.getCategories%c %O
  {success: true, data: [...]}
```

## Next Steps - CRITICAL

### 1. Fix tRPC Middleware (URGENT)
Check `/packages/api/src/trpc.ts` for:
- How `retailerProcedure` validates users
- How retailer ID is extracted from context
- Any hardcoded development checks

### 2. Debug Auth Context
- Log the actual auth context in API
- Verify JWT claims include retailer role
- Check if user ID matches retailer ID

### 3. Remove Mock Data Checks
Several routers have development mock checks:
```typescript
if (ctx.retailerId === 'mock-retailer-id' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')
```
These might be interfering with real data access.

## Comparison: Before vs After RLS Removal

| Metric | Before RLS Removal | After RLS Removal | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Overall Functionality | 75% | 75% | No change |
| 403 Errors | Yes | Yes | No change |
| Categories Loading | Yes | Yes | No change |
| Profile Access | No | No | No change |
| Cart Access | No | No | No change |

## Conclusion

**RLS removal had zero impact on the 403 errors**, proving the issue is in the application layer, not database layer. The problem is specifically in the tRPC middleware authorization logic.

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Check tRPC middleware** in `/packages/api/src/trpc.ts`
2. **Debug retailer context** extraction
3. **Remove development mock checks** from retailer routers
4. **Verify JWT token claims** include proper retailer identification

## Test Artifacts
- Screenshot: Categories page (empty cards but loading)
- Console logs: Persistent 403 errors on profile/cart
- Database state: RLS completely disabled

**Critical Finding**: The issue is NOT database permissions but API-level authorization in tRPC middleware.
