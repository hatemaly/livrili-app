- **purchase_order_items**: Line items for purchase orders
- **supplier_communications**: Communication logs with suppliers

### Key Features
- **Performance Metrics**: Automated calculation of delivery rates and ratings
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes to supplier data
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for data access control

## Usage

## API Integration

The UI is ready for backend integration with the following API endpoints:

```typescript
// Supplier CRUD operations
api.suppliers.list.useQuery()
api.suppliers.create.useMutation()
api.suppliers.update.useMutation()
api.suppliers.delete.useMutation()
api.suppliers.getStats.useQuery()

// Bulk operations
api.suppliers.bulkUpdate.useMutation()
api.suppliers.duplicate.useMutation()

// Import/Export
api.suppliers.import.useMutation()
api.suppliers.export.useMutation()
```

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks key supplier performance indicators:

- **Overall Rating**: 1-5 stars based on multiple factors
- **On-time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of orders delivered on time
- **Quality Score**: Product quality assessment
- **Response Time**: Average response time to communications
- **Order Frequency**: How often orders are placed
- **Value Rating**: Cost competitiveness assessment
